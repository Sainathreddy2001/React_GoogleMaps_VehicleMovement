# Vehicle Tracking Google Maps Project

## Overview

This project is a web application that visualizes vehicle movement on a Google Map. It displays the vehicle's current location, tracks its path using a polyline, and features a control panel with Play, Stop, Replay buttons, and a dropdown menu to select different movement options. The project uses React and the Google Maps JavaScript API.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration**: Displays a Google Map with a moving vehicle marker.
- **Polyline Path**: Tracks the vehicle's route on the map.
- **Info Window**: Shows detailed vehicle data such as speed, distance, battery status, and more.
- **Control Panel**: Provides Play, Stop, Replay buttons, a progress bar, and a dropdown menu for selecting different date ranges for vehicle movement history.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sainathreddy2001/React_GoogleMaps_VehicleMovement.git
   

Navigate to the project directory:


cd vehicle-google-maps-project
Install dependencies:
npm install

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Google Maps API key:
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
Start the development server:
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
